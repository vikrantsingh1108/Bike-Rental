# Bike-Rental
Implemented Regression model on Bike Rental sharing dataset

1. Business case
The prediction of Bikes sharing on hourly basis helps us understand the requirements of the
bike at a particular station. We can learn if the allotted bike at that station is enough for
example, if the bike returned at a particular station is more than the slot then there is a need to
build another station nearby. The data can help us understand the number of bikes being rented
from the different station and the prediction can help us to refill new bikes. The task focuses on
predicting the hourly usage of bike considering day hours, weather conditions and seasons.
